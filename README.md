# JWT Demo

This project consists of 2 severs:
    - Express server handling incoming requests.
    - Experss server handling auth and JWT.

To start playing around with this code on your machine:

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone <git_link>
```

2. Install packages

```bash
npm install package.json
```

3. Run servers in 2 separate terminals:

```bash
# Run dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, Run auth server
num run authServer
```

Happy coding!
